## Introduction
This project focuses on the classification of news articles into different categories based on their topics. The dataset used in this exercise can be obtained from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XWdEwdxZ0p0h0vHXrRFQW8wz8csGhns9). It consists of a total of 20,000 news articles, divided into three sets: training, evaluation, and testing, with 20,000, 2,000, and 2,000 articles respectively. Each news article in the dataset contains the following elements:
- `title`: The title of the news article.
- `abstract`: A summary or abstract of the news article.
- `text`: The full text of the news article.
- `category`: The category or topic of the news article.

## Usage
To classify news articles into different categories, we used ParsBERT and logistic regression. You can refer to the code and model in the project files to understand the implementation details.
